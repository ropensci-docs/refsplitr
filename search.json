Correctly identifying authors research product fundamental bibliometric research, ability correctly attribute given author scholarly output. However, seemingly straightforward task often extremely complicated, even using nominally high-quality data extracted bibliometric databases (reviewed Smalheiser Torvik 2009). obvious case different authors identical names, can quite common countries (Strotmann et al. 2009). However, confusion might also arise result journal conventions individual preferences abbreviating names. instance, one might conclude “J. C. Smith”, “Jennifer C. Smith”, “J. Smith” different authors, fact person. contrast, papers “E. Martinez” written different authors last name whose first names start letter (e.g., “Enrique”, “Eduardo”). Failure disambiguate author names can seriously undermine conclusions SciSci studies, manually verifying author identity quickly becomes impractical number authors papers dataset increases. second challenge working large bibliometric data-sets correctly parsing author addresses. structure author affiliations complex idiosyncratic, journals differ information require authors provide way present . Authors may also represent affiliations different ways different articles. instance, affiliations might written different ways different journals (e.g., “Dept. Biology”, “Department Biology”, “Departamento de Biologia”). true institution’s name (“UC Davis”, “University California-Davis”,“University California”) country based (“USA”, “United States”, “United States America”). Researchers academic institutions might include one Centers, Institutes, Colleges, Departments, Programs address, researchers working institution based units geographically disparate locations (e.g., University Florida researchers based main campus Gainesville one dozens facilities across state, including 12 Research Education Centers, 5 field stations, 67 County Extension Offices). Finally, affiliations recorded single field reference’s bibliographic record, despite comprising different types information (e.g., city, postal code, institution). concert, factors can make challenging conduct analyses author affiliation location particular interest.

First, authors unique identifier ORCID iD (ORCID) ResearcherID (RID). Second, author’s name can vary time. can also reported inconsistently accross journals. instance, author last names always reported, first names might represented initials middle names (authors one) might reported might stored middle initial. Finally, information “address” field can inconsistent structures. addition, 2008 Web Sceince records directly link author institutional address. result, pre-2008 Web Science records can difficult relate author institutional address (true emaail addresses). cases, way reliably match addresses authors using information reference record therefore insert ‘extracted’ address field. mean address listed assigned manual inspection - way discern author address belongs. Coupled changes author addresses change institutions, inconsistent incomplete information associated author addresses makes disambiguating names difficult. address ’ve created process identify clusters common authors iteratively building webs authors using available information link groups together. way require entry contain relevant fields, can nevertheless create likely groupings refine throwing obvious spurious connections. case authors ORCID RID numbers, identifying commonalities quite easy, hope authors continue sign identifiers facilitate disambiguation. first step disambiguation process matching groups together common ORCID RID numbers. remaining entries go series logical rules help match author likely entries. Throughout analysis assume every author complete last name require author’s record contain two following: first name, middle name, address, email (first middle name can initials). Requiring type information means match authors contain extra information, group entries middle name, address, email, instead call group skip following analysis. lower calculation times, algorithm attempts match entry creates subset possible matching combinations last first names, attempts match middle initials, address, email addresses. note regarding email addresses - Similar street addresses, email addresses often stored inconsistently direct link specific author specific email address. cases, run Jaro-Winkler distance measurement calculates amount transpositions required turn one string (author name) another (email address). works well email addresses standard format (e.g., “lastname”.”firstname” @ university.edu). match author names email use threshold percentage 0.70. names match threshold disregard email leave field blank author name. example algorithm processes sample data set.
